README.md has the outline and purpose of this project. Read that first.

## Project Structure

`README.md` has the outline and purpose of this project. Read that first.
`py-GACCIA` should have the python implementation of GACCIA
`ts-GACCIA` should have the typescript implementation of GACCIA
`results` is where the all the results from a run and are placed in a timestamped folder (including orginal code, generated code, eval results, logs from the run, and generated images)
`data` is where our test code is that we use during development
`AGENTS.md` (the current file) is a dynamic file where we describe the structure of the codebase, current work and plans, and is our working communication doc for the project. It is especially useful for coding agents to keep track of what they're all working on and have the current correct context.
