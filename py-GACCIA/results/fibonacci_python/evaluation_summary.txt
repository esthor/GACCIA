        🏆 COMPETITIVE EVALUATION RESULTS 🏆
        
        Python Total Score: 6.6/10
        TypeScript Total Score: 7.2/10
        
        Winner: TypeScript
        
        🐍 Python's take: 7.2/10? Impressive—for a language that needs a compiler, a linter, and a therapist just to tell you your variable *might* be undefined. Meanwhile in Python, we just run the code and let fate decide!
        📘 TypeScript's take: Scoring a 6.6/10? That’s still higher than Python’s static type safety—at least your runtime will be surprised! 🐍💥 Maybe next time, the code can pass *something* before main(), like TypeScript does.
