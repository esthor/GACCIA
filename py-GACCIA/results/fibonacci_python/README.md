# GACCIA Session Report

**Session ID:** `433b4d07-fa77-486d-b295-d79382175f66`  
**Date:** 2025-05-31 16:21:03  
**Original Language:** Python  

## 🏆 Final Results

**Winner:** TypeScript  
**Final Scores:**
- 🐍 Python: 6.6/10
- 📘 TypeScript: 7.2/10

## 💬 Competitive Snark

**🐍 Python's take:** 7.2/10? Impressive—for a language that needs a compiler, a linter, and a therapist just to tell you your variable *might* be undefined. Meanwhile in Python, we just run the code and let fate decide!  
**📘 TypeScript's take:** Scoring a 6.6/10? That’s still higher than Python’s static type safety—at least your runtime will be surprised! 🐍💥 Maybe next time, the code can pass *something* before main(), like TypeScript does.
